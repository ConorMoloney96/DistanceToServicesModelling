# DistanceToServicesModelling
This project uses Machine Learning techniques to predict the distance to key services (i.e. nearest doctor, ER, school) in Northern Ireland. The most accurate of these models obtained R^2 scores of 0.84, indicating a strong predictive power. These predictions could be used by home-buyers to quickly identify areas to focus on or by the government in urban planning to optimize placement of key services to best serve the community
